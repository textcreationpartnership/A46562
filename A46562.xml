            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Sir Thomas,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NOw is the day at hand in which your ſtrong held Soul and Body muſt be diſunited and
diſſolved by Death: I ſhall not here ſtand to mention the hainouſneſs of your crime,
and the Merits of your Death. You are now ſhortly to appear before the Righteous Judge of Heaven
and Earth, for whoſe unavoidable Aſſize I hope you prepare for; <hi>Conſcientia mille
teſtes,</hi> there is no Bribing, no Subornation of Juries nor Evidence; If your own Heart
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you, God is greater then your Heart, and knoweth all things: It is no great matter to
ſtand upon thoſe punctillions of honour, how, or after what manner you ſhall make your
<hi>exit,</hi> and Death cloſe your Eyes; Whether longer or ſhorter? whether Nobly or
Ignominiouſly? (as to Worldly Fame) whether in the Field or in the Bed? whether by the Axe or the
Gibbet? It is your Soul I aim at: It is true your Crime was great here, (I beg your Pardon) I do
not
<pb facs="tcp:49957:2"/>
intend to inſult over one, <hi>Mortuus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Lege,</hi> a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man a dead Lyon: But that I
may by theſe juſt conſiderations, raiſe the Spring of your Soul to a right conſideration,
and a true pitch for Eternity; and as your Life makes attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the King, it muſt be your
true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Prayers and Tears with ſtrong Sighs and Groans that muſt make attonement
through Chriſt to God Almighty, which is the only thing I heartily deſire for, and am fellow
Labourer with you: That this your ſincere and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may ſo animate your Soul, that
may prepare it for an Eternal weight of Glory.</p>
            <p>The beſt Cordial I can give you, or preſcribe to you in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſeaſe (<hi>In
terticulo morbis</hi>) is the Word of God: Where I ſhall firſt adviſe you to Read as ſoon
as may be, <hi>That you find your Soul hovering after Eternal Happineſs,</hi> is the 88
<hi>Pſalm,</hi> both as it is in the <hi>Bible</hi> and alſo alter'd ſomething in the
<hi>Common-Prayer-Book:</hi> There is nothing in the whole Word of God doth more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with
your preſent condition. And this truly humbling to you, and inclining your Soul to ſeek for
Soul ſaving comfort, turn to the 55 of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6 and 7 <hi>ver.</hi> Other promiſes
of Mercy I doubt not but you will apply to your ſelf, and in that ſafe way and Method our dear
Lord and Saviour hath Scour'd out unto you, from his own Promiſſes and Interceſſion. Thus
prepared like <hi>Moſes</hi> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord, when he had by God himſelf his day and
place appointed for Death, in the 32 of <hi>Deut.</hi> and ſo on, <hi>He is nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed,
but Sings his Song, makes his Speech, gives his Bleſſing, goes chearfully up at the Command of
God and Dyes.</hi> I pray God ſo Bleſſed a Saint may be your Pattern, and that your Sins may
be freely Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, and your Soul may be Eternally ſaved.</p>
            <closer>Is the moſt Ardent deſire, and Prayers of
<signed>him that was your Acquaintance, and now a poor Interceſſor at the Throne of Grace, for you.</signed>
